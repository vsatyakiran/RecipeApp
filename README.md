View app using the link : https://vsatyakiran.github.io/RecipeApp/

The recipe app was build by using pure basic HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

The data that is fetching has been collected using the **themealDB website's api (https://www.themealdb.com/)**. 
In this site there will be different API's available for free to use.
In this recipe app I have used **"Search Meal by Name API"** ( **www.themealdb.com/api/json/v1/1/search.php?s=Arrabiata** ).Fetch and asyc function javascript does all the remaining job.
